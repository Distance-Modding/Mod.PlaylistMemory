# PlaylistMemory

This Distance mod remembers which playlist you start and takes you back to it when you return to the main menu.

## Why do I need this mod?

By default, when you return to the main menu, the game takes you to the first playlist that contains the level you left. This can be one of the campaign collections, the Workshop collection or any other of your collections. You would then have to navigate to your original playlist if you just wanted to skip a few levels.

## Features

- Remembers the last playlist you clicked in singleplayer.
- Remembers the last playlist you selected a level from in multiplayer.
- Remembers playlists beyond game restarts.
- Properly remembers your last selected or played level, beyond game restarts as well. By default, this was only the case...
  - in Campaign under certain circumstances.
  - in Arcade, when opening the leaderboard of a level or starting a level from a leaderboard.
  - in Multiplayer.
